# Data Science Eduction Community Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Education Repository!

This is a Community of Practice repository that provides a space for educators who are teaching introductory level data science to share materials and showcase their work. Contributions to this repo consist of short articles about data science curricula, including lessons, modules, and courses. Each article includes a link to a GitHub repo that stores relevant curriculum materials, such as Jupyter notebooks.

To browse the materials, please visit the main website:
