## Description
DISCOVERY is an open-access data science resource created by the University of Illinois and used as the basis for STAT/CS/IS 107: Data Science Discovery and several other courses. Our mission is to create the most valuable Data Science resource available, both for students at the University of Illinois and for any other learner online.

You will find hundreds of pages of high-quality content, primarily divided up into four sections:

Data Science Lessons each contain a deep-dive into core Data Science topics, divided up into six modules. Every single lesson contains conversation "office hour"-style lectures with Professors Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider and Karle Flanagan, written explanations, example worksheets, practice questions, and more!

Data Science Guides are short, solution-focused examples of common tasks in Data Science. We create several new guides each week, so there is constantly something new!

Data Science Datasets are clean, documented, and relevant datasets for Data Science. As we use a new dataset in any of courses or research, we add the dataset here for you to use!

Data Science MicroProjects are guided, detailed projects that provide "micro" exploration of a new dataset. Each MicroProject is designed to give you a real data science experience in Python in under and hour!
