## Course Description
Data is everywhere in the modern world. Each of us has access to data on virtually any topic imaginable via the internet, and public and private institutions are making use of data in decision-making more than ever before. However, access to data is not the same thing as access to information. The purpose of this course is to develop some of the foundational skills needed to consume data and create information. The main theme in the course is understanding the sources of data, the variability inherent in data, and the inherent uncertainty associated with conclusions drawn from data.

The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets from a variety of disciplines. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

## Prerequisites
This course does not have any prerequisites beyond high-school algebra (and a desire to learn). The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics or computer science courses, which is one of the reasons why this course is open only to the first- and second-year students. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course.
